        <ul>
          <li>You can add this app to your phone's home-screen for a smoother experience. From your browser <em>Share</em> menu, press "Add to Home screen".</li>
          <li>Most of the search options (like year or categories) also sort by their boardgamegeek ranking.</li>
          <li>The convention offers free wifi, use it!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Thanks to BGG!</h2>
        <p>All the board game data used here is from the amazing folks at boardgamegeek.com, thanks to their open API service. Kudos.</p>

        <h2>Who Made This?</h2>
        <p>My name is Mike, and I created this little app simply because I love DTC. With the growing size, I wanted a way to easily find fellow gamers and the games I want to play.</p>
        <p>The app isn't perfect, and I have plenty of design improvements I want to make. But, if you've enjoyed using this app to find games to play, track me down for a high five!</p>
